<h1>Teachometer G Suite Add-on Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Which permissions are needed for Teachometer?</h2>

<p>When you use Teachometer for the first time, youâ€™ll be asked to accept the minimum-required permissions:</p>

    <div class=left>
    <table>

    <tr>
        <td><h3>Required permission</h3></td>
        <td>	<h3>Explanation of usage</h3></td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
        <td><h3> Spreadsheets</h3>
        <li>See, edit, create and delete your spreadsheet in Google Drive.</td>
        <td>Lesson content is stored in Google Sheets. Teachometer needs to read that information and copy it into the lesson builder sidebar. Teachometer does <b>not</b> access any of your Google sheets other than the currently opened one. Teachometer does <b>not</b> create or delete any of your Google sheets. When you upload a lesson, Teachometer does create a Google sheet <i>in its own Google drive</i> and shares it with you so you have access.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><h3>APIs</h3>
        <li>Connect to an external service</td>
        <td>When you upload a lesson, Teachometer sends that data to the Teachometer website which enables your students to view it</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
        <td><h3> Web content</h3>
        <li>Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications</td>
        <td>When you add resources to the lesson builder sidebar, Teachometer needs to show that content in the sidebar. This includes images which may be hosted on other websites.</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Why does Teachometer need these permissions?</h2>

Teachometer is integrated with G Suite apps like Sites and Sheets. It requires access to the Google environment to provide services seamlessly across the G Suite apps. 
Teachometer only requests the minimum-required permissions that are essential for it to function optimally.

Teachometer has no access to your Google account, nor your personal details, nor your email address and certainly not your password.</p>


<h2>Where can I review or revoke these permissions?</h2>
