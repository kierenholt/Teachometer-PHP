<h2>Why does Teachometer need these permissions?</h2>

Teachometer is integrated with G Suite apps like Sites and Sheets. It requires access to the Google environment to provide services seamlessly across the G Suite apps. 
Teachometer only requests the minimum-required permissions that are essential for it to function optimally.

Teachometer has no access to your Google account, nor your personal details, nor your email address and certainly not your password.</p>


<h2>Where can I review or revoke these permissions?</h2>
