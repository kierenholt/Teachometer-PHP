<h2>Teachometer G Suite Add-on Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Which permissions are needed for Teachometer?</h3>

<p>When you use Teachometer for the first time, youâ€™ll be asked to accept the minimum-required permissions:</p>

    <div class=left>
    <table>

    <tr>
        <td><h3>Required permission</h3></td>
        <td>	<h3>Explanation of usage</h3></td>
    </tr>

<tr><td><h3> Spreadsheets</h3></td></tr>

    <tr>
        <td><li>View and manage spreadsheets that this application has been installed in</td>
        <td>Lesson content is stored in Google Sheets. Teachometer needs to read that information and copy it into the lesson builder sidebar. Teachometer does <b>not</b> access any of your Google sheets other than the currently opened one. Teachometer does <b>not</b> create or delete any of your Google sheets. When you upload a lesson, Teachometer creates a Google sheet <i>in its own Google drive</i> and shares it with you so you have full access.</td>
    </tr>

<tr><td><h3>APIs</h3></td></tr>

    <tr>
        <td><li>Connect to an external service</td>
        <td>When you upload a lesson, Teachometer sends that data to the Teachometer website which enables your students to view it</td>
    </tr>

<tr>        <td><h3> Web content</h3></td></tr>

    <tr>
        <td><li>Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications</td>
        <td>When you add resources to the lesson builder sidebar, Teachometer needs to show that content in the sidebar. This includes images which may be hosted on other websites.</td>
